    The gaps use relative objective units (``1e-4`` means 0.01%).  ``M`` is the
    per-flight benefit in the maximize master objective ``M - delay_s``; it is
    deliberately much larger than the shipped ground-delay budget so a usable
    trajectory dominates cancellation.  ``time_limit_s`` is a best-effort
    whole-solve wall budget: pricing and native LP/IP calls receive the remaining
    time, with checks between graph, seed, and lazy-separation rounds.  A single
    synchronous geometry/backend call cannot be preempted and may overrun slightly.

    # measured at ~4.7 ms per try on a 425-column colgen_test master, so 32 -> 64 costs
    # +147 ms per iteration against pricing sweeps of ~100 s. That is what the
    # `heuristic_gap` termination and the `ip_skipped` decision key on, so the restarts buy
